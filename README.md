# root-finding
This repo consists of 4 numerical root-finding algorithms in MATLAB. Each method takes the function file **thefunc.m** to find the root of, with a variable or vector **x** as the input and **y** as the output, this function can be changed by the user. 

The code file named **bisection.m** uses the bisection method to find the root of the function **thefunc.m** using **if** statements and **while** loop. It takes the initial values **x_l = -1**, **x_u = 1** and an error tolerance of 0.005.
